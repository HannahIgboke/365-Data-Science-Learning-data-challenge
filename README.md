# 365 Data Science, Learning Data Challenge - My analysis.

A learning data challenge organized by 365 Data Science.

# About the analysis

For this challenge, I am taking on the role of a data scientist at 365. My task is to analyze data on student engagement, gather insights and identify key opportunities for improvement, whilst keeping in mind the metrics 365's CEO might find useful.
The questions below form the basis for my analysis:

1. Which courses are the most watched by students? How are they rated?

2. How would you define engagement (based on onboarding and exams/quizzes taken)?

3. What key metrics are relevant to the problem?

4. How many students register each month?

5. Do students watch more content with time?

6. How do the students engage with the platform based on user type (free or paid), subscription type (monthly, quarterly, or annual) and country.

7. Which are the countries with the most students registered? Does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
